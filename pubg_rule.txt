PUBG is a last-team-standing battle royale where up to 100 players drop onto a map, gather weapons and gear, and fight until only one player or squad remains. A shrinking blue zone forces players toward conflict, and the final survivor wins.
Maps vary by playlist and region. Erangel is 8×8 km with fields, forests, towns, rivers, and bridges, offering balanced cover and sightlines. Miramar is an 8×8 km desert with long sightlines and tall buildings. Taego, also 8×8 km, is a forest-and-field map with many vehicles. Deston is 8×8 km and mixes tall city clusters, swamps, and open fields for strong vertical play. Vikendi is 6×6 km with snowy mountains and frozen rivers. Sanhok and Rondo are both 4×4 km, providing dense jungle or East-Asian terrain for fast engagements. Paramo is about 3–4 km, volcanic and partly reconfigured every match. Karakin is the smallest at 2×2 km, featuring very rapid pacing and destructible walls. Larger maps emphasize vehicles and long-range fights; smaller maps push quick combat. Each map keeps fixed geography but randomizes the flight path, safe zones, red zones, weather, and loot each match.
A match flows through set stages. After the lobby countdown, one plane flies a random path. Players jump and freefall, steering and gliding until parachutes open (auto-deploy if not manually opened). Early game is about looting and securing ground. Midgame focuses on rotating with safe zones, upgrading gear, and engaging or avoiding fights. Endgame happens inside a tiny circle with little cover, demanding decisive action. Final results show placement, kills, damage, and other stats.
Players can walk, sprint, crouch, go prone, jump, vault, climb, swim, and dive. They can fire in single, burst, or auto mode, reload, swap weapons, throw grenades, and use melee. They aim either hip-fire or aim-down-sights (ADS), can lean left or right, and hold breath to steady high-magnification scopes. Interaction includes opening doors, reviving teammates, using heals or boosts, picking up or dropping items, and driving vehicles. First-person (FPP) and third-person (TPP) views are supported, with identical gunplay but different sightlines and peeking options.
Health ranges from 0 to 100. In squad play, reaching 0 HP causes Down-But-Not-Out (DBNO), letting you crawl and await revival; repeated knocks shorten bleed-out time. In solo mode, 0 HP means instant death. Helmets protect the head and vests protect the torso, with higher levels offering greater damage reduction and durability. Damage multipliers mean headshots hurt most, followed by torso shots and limb hits.
Healing and boost items include bandages for small over-time heals, First Aid Kits to restore health to a safe level, and Med Kits for full 100 HP recovery. Energy Drinks, Painkillers, and Adrenaline fill a Boost bar that gradually regenerates health and, when full, gives a slight speed bonus.
Weapons come in several families. Assault rifles (AR) are versatile and medium range. Designated marksman rifles (DMR) are semi-auto or slow auto and excel at medium-long range. Sniper rifles (SR) are bolt-action or semi-auto with the highest single-shot damage. Submachine guns (SMG) deliver high rate of fire at close range. Light machine guns (LMG) have large magazines for sustained fire but more recoil. Shotguns provide extreme close-range burst damage. Handguns are sidearms for early or emergency use. Crossbows and other niche weapons can be deadly with stealth. Melee items such as pans, machetes, and crowbars can deal damage and break windows quietly.
Attachments modify performance. Muzzles include compensators for recoil control, flash hiders to reduce muzzle flash and slightly stabilize, and suppressors to cut sound and flash. Magazines come as extended for more bullets, quick-draw for faster reloads, or extended quick-draw for both. Grips lower vertical and horizontal recoil or sway and sometimes improve ADS speed and shot recovery. Stocks and cheek pads reduce sway and recoil. Some weapons accept special tactical attachments.
Optics include 1× sights (Red Dot, Holographic, and Canted Sight, which lets players switch instantly to a 1× view when a magnified scope is equipped). Magnified scopes come in 2×, 3×, 4×, 6×, 8×, and 15× levels. Higher magnification slows ADS and increases sway. ARs accept 1× through 6× scopes. DMRs and SRs accept up to 8×, while 15× is rare and mostly from care packages. SMGs, shotguns, and handguns usually stay at 1× or limited low magnification.
Loot spawns in several ways: randomized ground items, supply drops from planes, special locked rooms or sites that require keys, and crates dropped by defeated players. Rarity tiers guide expectations. Common items include pistols, shotguns, basic SMGs or ARs, Level-1 armor, and bandages. Uncommon items include extended mags, compensators, mid-tier optics, Level-2 armor, and reliable ARs, DMRs, or SMGs. Rare items add high-power optics, advanced attachments, Level-3 armor, and strong DMRs or SRs. Very rare or crate-only items include the AWM and Lynx AMR sniper rifles, Groza and FAMAS ARs, MG3 LMG, P90 SMG, DBS shotgun, and the 15× scope. The Level-3 helmet is usually crate or special-room only.
Throwables and tactical items are key. Frag grenades explode with lethal force in a small radius. Smoke grenades create opaque cover for pushes or revives. Stun grenades briefly blind and deafen opponents. Molotov cocktails ignite and damage areas over time. Blue-Zone grenades, when enabled, create a temporary damaging blue field. Special gear includes Flare Guns, which call in a special airdrop or armored vehicle if fired outside the safe zone, and Emergency Pickup balloons that let a plane carry an entire squad toward the circle. Other niche tools include foldable shields, mortars, and spike strips.
Vehicles such as cars, trucks, buggies, motorbikes, boats, and map-specific options provide crucial early and midgame mobility. They have defined speed, acceleration, handling, traction, fuel, and health. Tires can be shot to disable handling and a heavily damaged vehicle can burn and explode. Vehicles are loud and easy to spot, so they are best abandoned before final circles unless rapid movement is essential.
The blue zone follows a predictable pattern. A white safe circle appears. After a delay, the blue zone contracts toward the white circle, then stops briefly before the next white circle is revealed inside. Each phase raises blue-zone damage, making late zones quickly fatal. Players must track shrink timing, damage per second, movement speed, terrain, and available healing to plan safe rotations. The red zone, when enabled, randomly bombards an area; buildings give protection and competitive playlists often disable it.
Gunfights depend on precise ballistics. Recoil has vertical and horizontal elements, controlled by stance, attachments, and firing discipline. High-magnification scopes increase sway, which can be reduced by holding breath. Bullets travel with time delay, drop at long range, and lose damage over distance, requiring players to lead moving targets and compensate for drop. Thin materials like some wooden panels may be penetrable, while glass never blocks bullets.
Team play relies on communication and coordination. Players place pings and markers, share loot and ammo, and revive teammates using smoke and off-angles. Good callouts of enemy bearings and movement are vital.
To win, land in a location with strong cover, vehicles, and dense loot. Reach at least Level-2 armor and two solid weapons quickly. Keep inventory balanced with priority on heals, smokes, and primary ammo. Always carry a 1× sight even when using higher magnification. Engage only when you have positional or numerical advantage. In the endgame, use smokes and molotovs to control space, pre-aim likely peeks, and play carefully to be the last squad alive.
